Pre-requisites:
MySql workbench
Springboot
AWS account
Docker
Eclipse
AWS Toolkit for Eclipse
Installation
Download the zip file and import onto Eclipse. On AWS create an RDS database instance. Use your RDS endpoint url to connect to MySql. Next, open up the Springboot application locally and on the application properties file, include your RDS endpoint url, and your MySql credentials as well. After including that information on the application properties file, you can deploy the Springboot application on your localhost server. The Springboot application will now be connected to your MySql and your RDS instance as well. Once you have ensured connection, launch an AWS EC2 instance. On Eclipse, using the AWS Toolkit, connect to your EC2 instance by providing the required credentials information including your key-pair. Finally, create a new Elastic Beanstalk environment on AWS so we can deploy our Eclipse project. Once the Elastic Beanstalk environment is up and running, export a WAR file from the Eclipse project and upload it to the Elastic BeanStalk Environment. The application should now be available to view by clicking on the web app url given on AWS.

Docker
Use the dockerfile for the docker setup. Run this command below to build the project with the dockerfile where springboot is located.

docker build -t myorg/myapp .

Then, run this command below to run the springboot application containerized in docker:

docker run -p 8080:8080 myorg/myapp

The application will now run on localhost:8080 inside of docker. Since the application has now been containerized, we can now upload the project to dockerhub and deploy it to any system including the aws system.
